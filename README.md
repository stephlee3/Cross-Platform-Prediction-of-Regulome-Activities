# Cross-Platform-Prediction-of-Regulome-Activities

## Overview
This is the project for Cross-Platform Predicition of Regulome Activities based on gene expression data. The goal is to use human exon array data to train the prediction model, then apply it to the gene expression data from different platforms.(e.g. affymetrix microarray data from GEO, or RNA-seq data from ENCODE project).
